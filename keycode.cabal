synopsis:            Maps web browser keycodes to their corresponding keyboard keys
description:         Keyboard events in web browsers are often represented as keycodes,
                     which (1) are difficult to remember, and (2) sometimes vary from
                     browser to browser. "Web.KeyCode" allows one to look up a key
                     press's keycode and get a plain English description of the key
                     that was pressed, to reduce confusion.
